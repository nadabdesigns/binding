			<p class="paragraph1">Graphic design history, like the history of many American industries, excludes Black
				practitioners’ work and methods, which I suspect is the reason why there are so few of us in the
				profession now. So in response, I’ve curated “As, Not For: Dethroning Our Absolute” an exhibition
				celebrating the work of African-American designers, partially as a bit of soul searching for myself, but
				mostly as an effort to foster educational and professional equity in the industry.
