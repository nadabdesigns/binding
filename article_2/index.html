				<p class="paragraph1" lang="en">What influence have African Americans had on contemporary graphic
					design? Is there such a thing as an African-American design aesthetic? These are questions that I
					have been asking designers and art historians for the last ten years. The answer I am usually given
					is, "I don't know."The relationship of ethnic minorities to the development of American graphic
					design is rarely discussed or documented by our profession because of the historic lack of racial
					diversity in the field. However, increasing numbers of African Americans entering the profession are
					calling for a fresh look at graphic design history in order to discover the aesthetic contributions
					of their people.

					In 1971, when I entered design school, there was only one other black student in
					attendance. Twenty-five years later, this situation has improved slightly. Today, I teach
					graphic design at the university level and have one or two black students in my department
					each year. Those students often exhibit insecurities that negatively affect their performance.
					In fact, they experience a problem common to many black design professionals: the
					feeling that they are ·not completely welcome in the profession. Lack of exposure to the
					prevailing aesthetic traditions also puts them at a disadvantage. This outsider posture leads
					many black designers to compulsively imitate and assimilate mainstream aesthetic traditions
					in order to feel accepted and be successful. More often than not, black designers and
					students are trapped in a strategy of imitation rather than innovation.
					<br>
					The graphic design profession is driven by visual innovation. The most visible and celebrated
					designers
					are those who are continuously innovating within, or in opposition to, the prevailing schools of
					design
					thought. Black designers are working at a disadvantage when they do not feel a kinship with existing
					design traditions and also have no evidence of an alternative African or African-American design
					tradition upon which to base their work. In 1995, Claude Steele completed groundbreaking research on
					the
					links between performance and self-esteem, which indicated that self-confidence may be the single
					most
					important influence in the lives of successful African Americans. For instance, the spectacular
					success
					of black musicians demonstrates the relationship between confidence, leadership, and success. Black
					musicians have been successful because they feel confident and secure about their work. They are
					secure
					because they are working within intimately known traditions built by others like themselves, and
					they are motivated by the thrill of adding to that successful body of work.

					Is there a potential design tradition that can fuel black designers in the same way that black music
					traditions fuel black musicians? By "black tradition" I do not mean black subject matter or imagery,
					but the styling and expressions common to people of African descent. I believe this tradition does
					exist, but black contributions to America's rich graphic design history have been overlooked, so
					far, by design historians who have focused either on European influences or on the current
					phenomenon of cultural hybridity. Buried in libraries and design journals is evidence of black
					graphic styles and influences stretching from the New Negro movement of the 1920s through the
					hip-hop aesthetics of the latest generation of designers. I believe that this material, if
					uncovered, has the potential to nurture a new generation of designers.

					Chronicling the work of these pioneers is an important first step, but most of these brave people
					were so concerned with surviving within a hostile profession that their work expresses little that
					is uniquely African American. I believe that the building blocks of a black design aesthetic are
					scattered across many disciplines and will be found in unlikely places. For instance, some of the
					best examples of the potential for a black design vocabulary are found in the work of white
					designers who have been inspired by black culture and take advantage of the market for black
					expressive styles.

							We must also look outside the design disciplines to the performing arts and to fine
arts movements, such as the Afri-Cobra, which have based visual explorations on African
and jazz rhythms. We can study these disciplines for characteristic black expression
(improvisation, distortion, polyrhythms, exaggeration, call and response) that can be
translated into graphic form. Black design traditions must be pieced together from a
variety of sources to make a complete canon of black expression.

				<p class="paragraph1" lang="en">
					In discussion with design educators (both black and white), many argue that to focus too much
					attention on black aesthetics will limit the full creative expression of black designers. They argue
					that black designers have spent the last twenty years working to erase race and class bias in the
					profession; to them a focus on blackness invites discrimination. I disagree. Black designers have
					access, training, and opportunity; what they lack is the drive that comes from innovation. And in
					order to thrive, in~ovation requires a tradition to either build on or oppose. It is up to us as
					historians and educators to research and teach in a way that addresses the unique cultural
					experience of all our students. Right now, black design students would benefit greatly from a study
					of their design traditions. Otherwise, they may be doomed to a future of bad imitations.

					In his first design history book, A History of Graphic Design, Philip Meggs stated that "a collision
					between cubist painting and futurist poetry spawned twentieth-century graphic design." Early
					twentieth-century cubist artists were obsessed with visualizing modern technological and social
					freedom. The style of the non-Western people of the world, particularly those who had perfected
					forms of abstraction and symbolism, were quickly drawn into the stylistic vortex created by this
					modernist revolution. In this way, black graphic expressions made their debut in the Western world
					indirectly,

					<span class="bigName"> <br>Georges Braque,<br>Pablo Picasso,</span>
						<br>and<br><span class="bigName"> Fernand Leger.<br></span>All these artists later acknowledged the significant impact of African art on their work;</span>
	
				</p>
				
				<p class="firstText">
					
					however, most scholarly writing about cubism has obscured its African roots. Postmodern art
					scholarship, starting with William Rubin's book "Primitivism" in Twentieth-Century Art: Affinity of
					the Tribal and the Modern, has begun to record and study the role of African art in the invention of
					cubism and the success of the modernist movement.

						The prolific jazz-age production of black art and design was cut short by the depression of
						the 1930s. However, during the thirties and early forties, a revival of black folk
						traditions occurred, prompted by the direct observations of a':lthropologists and
						folklorists such as Zora Neale Hurston, Southern white writers such as DuBose Heyward, and
						interviewers for the WPA oral history project on slavery. Artists supported by federal arts
						programs and socialist groups interpreted black folk and labor themes in programs, posters,
						fliers, and other printed materials. It is not clear how much of this material was designed
						by blacks; examples buried in archives await inspection, interpretation, and inclusion in
						the design history texts.
