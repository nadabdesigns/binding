			Searching for a Black Aesthetic in American Graphic Design

				What influence have African Americans had on contemporary graphic design? Is there such a thing as an
				African-American design aesthetic? These are questions that I have been asking designers and art
				historians
				for the last ten years. The answer I am usually given is, "I don't know."The relationship of ethnic
				minorities to the development of American graphic design is rarely discussed or documented by our
				profession
				because of the historic lack of racial diversity in the field. However, increasing numbers of African
				Americans entering the profession are calling for a fresh look at graphic design history in order to
				discover the aesthetic contributions of their people.

				In 1971, when I entered design school, there was only one other black student in attendance. Twenty-five
				years later, this situation has improved slightly. Today, I teach graphic design at the university level
				and
				have one or two black students in my department each year. Those students often exhibit insecurities
				that
				negatively affect their performance. In fact, they experience a problem common to many black design
				professionals: the feeling that they are not completely welcome in the profession. Lack of exposure to
				the
				prevailing aesthetic traditions also puts them at a disadvantage. This outsider posture leads many black
				designers to compulsively imitate and assimilate mainstream aesthetic traditions in order to feel
				accepted
				and be successful. More often than not, black designers and students are trapped in a strategy of
				imitation
				rather than innovation.

				The graphic design profession is driven by visual innovation. The most visible and celebrated designers
				are those who are continuously innovating within, or in opposition to, the prevailing schools of design
				thought. Black designers are working at a disadvantage when they do not feel a kinship with existing design
				traditions and also have no evidence of an alternative African or African-American design tradition upon
				which to base their work.

				In 1995, Claude Steele completed groundbreaking research on the links between performance and
				self-esteem,
				which indicated that self-confidence may be the single most important influence in the lives of
				successful
				African Americans. For instance, the spectacular success of black musicians demonstrates the
				relationship
				between confidence, leadership, and success. Black musicians have been successful because they feel
				confident and secure about their work. They are secure because they are working within intimately known
				traditions built by others like themselves, and they are motivated by the thrill of adding to that
				successful body of work.

				Is there a potential design tradition that can fuel black designers in the same way that black music
				traditions fuel black musicians? By "black tradition," I do not mean black subject matter or imagery,
				but
				the styling and expressions common to people of African descent. I believe this tradition does exist,
				but black
				contributions to America's rich graphic design history have been overlooked so far by design historians,
				who
				have focused either on European influences or on the current phenomenon of cultural hybridity. Buried in
				libraries and
				design journals is evidence of black graphic styles and influences stretching from the New Negro
				movement of the
				1920s through the hip-hop aesthetics of the latest generation of designers. I believe that this
				material, if
				uncovered, has the potential to nurture a new generation of designers.

			<p>
				How do we construct and document a black design tradition? There is already a small body of research on
				the
				lives of America's first black designers. Chronicling the work of these pioneers is an important first
				step,
				but most of these brave people were so concerned with surviving within a hostile profession that their
				work
				expresses little that is uniquely African American. I believe that the building blocks of a black design
				aesthetic are scattered across many disciplines and will be found in unlikely places. For instance, some
				of
				the best examples of the potential for a black design vocabulary are found in the work of white
				designers
				who have been inspired by black culture and take advantage of the market for black expressive styles.
			</p>

				We must also look outside the design disciplines to the performing arts and fine arts movements, such as
				the Afri-Cobra, which have based visual explorations on African and jazz rhythms. We can study these
				disciplines for characteristic black expression (improvisation, distortion, polyrhythms, exaggeration,
				call and
				response) that can be translated into graphic form. Black design traditions must be pieced together from
				a variety of sources to make a complete canon of black expression. In discussions with design educators
				(both black and white), many argue that to focus too much attention
				on black aesthetics will limit the full creative expression of black designers. They argue that black
				designers have spent the last twenty years working to erase race and class bias in the profession; to
				them, a
				focus on blackness invites discrimination. I disagree. Black designers have access, training, and
				opportunity;
				what they lack is the drive that comes from innovation. And in order to thrive, innovation requires a
				tradition to either build on or oppose. It is up to us as historians and educators to research and teach
				in a way
				that addresses the unique cultural experience of all our students. Right now, black design students
				would
				benefit greatly from a study of their design traditions. Otherwise, they may be doomed to a future of
				bad
				imitations.
