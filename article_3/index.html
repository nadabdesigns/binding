							<div id="blackExperience"> The Big Problem <br>With Design
						</h1>
						</id>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p class="paragraph1" lang="en">For all of the progress proclaimed by evangelists, little has changed
					from the previous century for design today. Designers still are overwhelmingly white with most
					executive positions continuing to be occupied by the 36% minority of men within the industry. This
					demographic truth, however, reflects a more urgent issue that manifests itself in structures that
					reify its status quo.

					With design becoming one of the most visible professions in the United States, who qualifies to
					enter its gates is of serious inquiry amidst the deepening socioeconomic divide between Americans.
					In spite of supposed attempts at diversifying the industry, entry is barred by arbitrary
					certification, exorbitant costs for design boot camps, and the saturation of work primarily to be
					reserved in rapidly gentrified urban centers.

					The consequences of this phenomenon reveal itself devastating. Communities are uprooted,
					socioeconomic mobility stagnates, and the original community members get pushed to the bottom, if
					not already neglected into destitute.

					This form of colonialism however was never unique to design nor the tech giants which have co-opted
					it. We have seen in modern history how the extraction of wealth takes many forms: the pillaging of
					indigenous lands, cultural appropriation, and wage theft which its victims today continue to be
					under Stockholm syndrome induced by their masters.

					Indeed, capitalism and its ruthless operations is nothing new to the United States but design
					appropriated as an extension to capitalist venture has never actually progressed simply because the
					tools now live digitally. Thus if design previously faced Modernism’s authoritarian sentiments and
					was then followed by Design Thinking’s conception, what truly separates the two if not a
					parent-child relationship?

					Instead, the current state of design is simply the digitally updated version of Eurocentric design
					doctrine and practice. The prescriptive nature of Modernism never escaped contemporary conversation,
					rather it became one of many rebrands in the 21st century to co-opt the weaponization of design.
					Indeed, Modernism has undergone a rebrand and today is marketed as “Design Thinking.”

							<h2>Modernism’s Ode to White Supremacy</h2>

						</div>

					</div>
					<p class="quoteBody">
						While Design Thinking has only recently taken the spotlight, its essence takes precedence from
						the Modernist movement. Pioneer Tim Brown frequently references Modernist practitioners
						including Charles and Ray Eames, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Isamu Noguchi as precursors to the
						Design Thinking dogma. But at what point of intersection intertwines Modernism to Design
						Thinking? Why is it that Modernism has acted as such a reference point for the Design Thinking
						doctrine?
						<br><br>
						This call towards modernization however extends beyond simply lifestyle choice. With other art
						movements against its backdrop (i.e. Dadaism, Constructivism), Modernists eventually absorbed
						many of them into a repackaged brand known historically as the Bauhaus. And as with any branding
						project, the margins which did not serve its brand were stripped from its significance,
						flattening a character into the Bauhaus. This colonization of cultural movements and ideas was
						nothing contradictory to Modernist ideology but in fact essential to its practice.
						<br><br>
						Consider sentiments many Modernists were vocal about. The Italian graphic designer Massimo
						Vignelli often is cited as defending the practice of using only four typefaces and disparaging
						“visual pollution.” Whether Vignelli realized his eugenics-adjacent language or not, his belief
						in the designer’s fight “against the ugliness” further cemented Modernist practice of erasure
						and consolidation.
						<br><br>
						To passionately argue against aesthetics unaligned with a certain canon of work is irrelevant
						when such argued-for aesthetics are inaccessible save a select group of people. The fact of the
						matter is that not all peoples use the Latin script or are even literate or are even visually
						unimpaired.
						<br><br>
						To view a certain collection of typefaces as the essential tool kit for typography immediately
						excludes billions of people as mentioned. Furthermore, should anyone outside of Europe need to
						use Latin characters, it is thanks to the complicated history of Western imperialism and the
						violent destruction of indigenous cultures. This history is endemic to Modernism and canonized
						itself into the popularly known institution as the International Style.
						<br><br>
						It is in this that Modernists often proclaimed design as neutral, viewing style as divorced from
						content and inheriting a universal ability to communicate to any human being. But to highlight
						once more, such aspirations to achieve this is impossible let alone prone to racism. Doing so
						renders all the nuances of humanity to a uniform visual code.
						<br><br>
						Consider Paul Rand who believed design and social issues ought to be kept separate. Do we take
						this as aesthetic judgments being universal truths forming within a vacuum devoid of cultural
						and historical reference? Even if only said out of ignorance, Rand’s practice still primarily
						served a Western audience, making his statements at best an irresponsible prescription for
						design.

							<br>The Radical Act of <br> Neutrality

							</h1>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p class="paragraph1" lang="en">
					This act of prescribing racelessness or more broadly neutrality is itself a racial or sided act. An
					urgent questioning forms: What is universal? What templates as neutral? What are our defaults?
					<br>
					<br>
					In white supremacy, whiteness is default. And through the creation of whiteness in America, anything
					outside of it acts as a difference in which it is vehemently targeted. In this context, the idea of
					what “American” is, is incredibly important when considering the idea of conventionally “American.”
					Toni Morrison posed it strikingly, “What parts do the invention and development of whiteness play in
					the construction of what is loosely described as “American?”
					<br>
					<br>
					In this respect, how can we earnestly look at “neutrality” or “universality” or “race-agnostic” if
					it lobotomizes design and diminishes the artist and their work? When we look at Modernism’s
					prescription of the world, it reveals itself as yet another byproduct of white supremacy, centering
					itself as the end-all approach to universal human aesthetics.
					<br>
					<br>
					We can see this as a dangerous act of conglomerating many different cultures into a monolith of
					“humanness” but we ought to underscore that such absorption goes further through the erasure of the
					margins and the elimination of difference.
					<br>
					<br>
					When the default is white, how can design as a “neutral” tool serve anything but whiteness? How can
					design as “universal” communicate when there is no universally adopted language? What is “clean”
					design if not contrasted with an “unclean” aesthetic relentlessly targeted?
					<br>
					<br>
					These sentiments are far from gone today. They have revived themselves into the current digital
					landscape. And when the systems go unchallenged, its byproducts maintain and perpetuate the
					manufacturing of these grim realities. What is Modernism if not the cultural weapon to erase
					nonwhite aesthetics? What then is Design Thinking if not its succeeding methodology for cultural
					white hegemony?

							<h2>Flat Design: <br>“
								A Homogenous Design Ideal </h2>

						</div>

					</div>
					<p class="quoteBody">
						Today, visual design no longer solely exists for example on the canvas of a poster nor the
						printed matter bound into books. It exists intangibly, embodying products completely removed
						from physical space. It works to represent businesses with no offices, or technology with no
						hardware.
						<br>
						<br>

						But the media in which design exists is not simply a container for visually communicated ideas.
						Design, as it always has been, lived with its content and was informed by the author. Thus what
						design puts out into the world always carries responsibility, always required criticality in its
						production.
						<br>
						<br>
						The state of affairs for design today, however, acquire a familiar yet different insidious
						development. Recall that in Modernism, design was “universal” only if it adopted a certain
						curated form, adhering to stylistics codes. Even going so far as to codify standards, the
						conversation of design accreditation tried transcending into institution. Were designers so
						insecure that the erecting of arbitrary gates seemed like the remedy to validate themselves? And
						yet while absurd to imagine, it is precisely the reality design today inherited.
						<br>
						<br>
						Design’s barrier to entry still works on behalf of the white supremacist capitalism which
						granted its existence. Consider the online courses or bootcamps which promise customers success
						in getting design jobs. IDEO’s “Insights for Innovation” course for example costs $499 for five
						weeks. Stanford’s d.school’s “Design Thinking Bootcamp” costs $12,600 for a modest four days.
						Now consider that the median household income of an average American working-class family in
						2019 is roughly $60,000.
						<br>
						<br>
						What then is so “human-centered” about Design Thinking if the average working-class family must
						first provide one-fifth of their income before contributing to it let alone being provided
						access? What is so “innovative” about its curricula if not a feedback loop that reiterates from
						an exclusionary, classist chamber? And when socioeconomic status is so deeply tied with race in
						America, who often are the admitted students?
						<br>
						<br>
						Yet it is not simply the botched, brute force development of Design Thinking’s curriculum formed
						from “move fast, break things” Silicon Valley pseudoscience that make it so harmful. While the
						aforementioned is incredibly irresponsible, the source of its phenomenon is the fact of its
						conception from white supremacy which nostalgically mirrors the prescriptive superiority complex
						of Modernism and the International Style.
						<br>
						<br>
						As Maggie Gram puts it, by embracing “Design Thinking,” we attribute to design a kind of
						superior epistemology: a way of knowing, of “solving,” that is better than any other method
						which differs. Reminiscent to the Modernists, by packaging Design Thinking as a promise to
						“good” design, all other nonconforming methods are flattened, dismissed, erased. The result is a
						homogenous digital landscape increasingly susceptible to biases maintained in white supremacy.
						<br>
						<br>
						What tie Modernism and Design Thinking so frighteningly close was the shared sentiment of
						catering to the “needs of humanity” and “centering the human in the design process.” Yet this
						assertion inevitably becomes empty since no single design approach can ever truly be universal
						or wholly ubiquitous to any one human experience.
						<br>
						<br>
						By bankrupting design through “neutrality” or “universal humanness,” making judgments through an
						ocean of sticky notes drowns cultural implications from its purview. The incessant insistence
						that “design is human” or that “design empathizes with the user” not only plays into white
						supremacist defaults of a user/human but also creates a carefully constructed lexicon which
						persuades lay people that design is a nonnegotiable product intended to be sold whether or not
						some lay people may fit the target audience to be served.
						<br>
						<br>
						The unchallenged mindset of seeing the world as a landscape to redesign and “make better” (as if
						everything in the world is a problem to be solved) is not so much to proselytize design itself
						but rather under capitalism to make morally just the existence of the corporations these design
						evangelists represent. At the end of the day, Design Thinking is so entrenched in capitalism
						that the euphemism of “human-centered design” is only so “human” as it relates to the underlying
						business model. And perhaps this is why criticism on Design Thinking seems so little considering
						its rigid framework does not provide a vocabulary for an alternative outside of raw capitalism.

					reflects two pieces of Locke’s writing: “As, Not For” is a three-word summary of a passage in his

					essential within the culture in which it exists. “Dethroning Our Absolutes” is from Locke’s
					philosophical essay, “Values and Imperatives,” which prompts readers to assess their subjectivities
					while being mindful that social norms guide our behavior. “Ritual: Baptismal in Black” asked its
					patrons questions that exposed the knowledge gaps the organizers attempted to fill: “Can your
					faculty/staff/students each name five nationally or internationally active Black artists?” and “Do
					your major art books include the work of major Black artists?”
