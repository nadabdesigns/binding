				</div>

				<p class="paragraph1" lang="en">For all of the progress proclaimed by evangelists, little has changed
					from the previous century for design today. Designers still are overwhelmingly white with most
					executive positions continuing to be occupied by the 36% minority of men within the industry. This
					demographic truth, however, reflects a more urgent issue that manifests itself in structures that
					reify its status quo.

					With design becoming one of the most visible professions in the United States, who qualifies to
					enter its gates is of serious inquiry amidst the deepening socioeconomic divide between Americans.
					In spite of supposed attempts at diversifying the industry, entry is barred by arbitrary
					certification, exorbitant costs for design boot camps, and the saturation of work primarily to be
					reserved in rapidly gentrified urban centers.

					The consequences of this phenomenon reveal itself devastating. Communities are uprooted,
					socioeconomic mobility stagnates, and the original community members get pushed to the bottom, if
					not already neglected into destitute.

					This form of colonialism however was never unique to design nor the tech giants which have co-opted
					it. We have seen in modern history how the extraction of wealth takes many forms: the pillaging of
					indigenous lands, cultural appropriation, and wage theft which its victims today continue to be
					under Stockholm syndrome induced by their masters.

					Indeed, capitalism and its ruthless operations is nothing new to the United States but design
					appropriated as an extension to capitalist venture has never actually progressed simply because the
					tools now live digitally. Thus if design previously faced Modernism’s authoritarian sentiments and
					was then followed by Design Thinking’s conception, what truly separates the two if not a
					parent-child relationship?

					Instead, the current state of design is simply the digitally updated version of Eurocentric design
					doctrine and practice. The prescriptive nature of Modernism never escaped contemporary conversation,
					rather it became one of many rebrands in the 21st century to co-opt the weaponization of design.
					Indeed, Modernism has undergone a rebrand and today is marketed as “Design Thinking.”

							<h2>Modernism’s Ode to White Supremacy</h2>

						</div>

					</div>
					<p class="quoteBody">
						While Design Thinking has only recently taken the spotlight, its essence takes precedence from
						the Modernist movement. Pioneer Tim Brown frequently references Modernist practitioners
						including Charles and Ray Eames, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Isamu Noguchi as precursors to the
						Design Thinking dogma. But at what point of intersection intertwines Modernism to Design
						Thinking? Why is it that Modernism has acted as such a reference point for the Design Thinking
						doctrine?
						<br><br>
						This call towards modernization however extends beyond simply lifestyle choice. With other art
						movements against its backdrop (i.e. Dadaism, Constructivism), Modernists eventually absorbed
						many of them into a repackaged brand known historically as the Bauhaus. And as with any branding
						project, the margins which did not serve its brand were stripped from its significance,
						flattening a character into the Bauhaus. This colonization of cultural movements and ideas was
						nothing contradictory to Modernist ideology but in fact essential to its practice.
						<br><br>
						Consider sentiments many Modernists were vocal about. The Italian graphic designer Massimo
						Vignelli often is cited as defending the practice of using only four typefaces and disparaging
						“visual pollution.” Whether Vignelli realized his eugenics-adjacent language or not, his belief
						in the designer’s fight “against the ugliness” further cemented Modernist practice of erasure
						and consolidation.
						<br><br>
						To passionately argue against aesthetics unaligned with a certain canon of work is irrelevant
						when such argued-for aesthetics are inaccessible save a select group of people. The fact of the
						matter is that not all peoples use the Latin script or are even literate or are even visually
						unimpaired.
						<br><br>
						To view a certain collection of typefaces as the essential tool kit for typography immediately
						excludes billions of people as mentioned. Furthermore, should anyone outside of Europe need to
						use Latin characters, it is thanks to the complicated history of Western imperialism and the
						violent destruction of indigenous cultures. This history is endemic to Modernism and canonized
						itself into the popularly known institution as the International Style.
						<br><br>
						It is in this that Modernists often proclaimed design as neutral, viewing style as divorced from
						content and inheriting a universal ability to communicate to any human being. But to highlight
						once more, such aspirations to achieve this is impossible let alone prone to racism. Doing so
						renders all the nuances of humanity to a uniform visual code.
						<br><br>
						Consider Paul Rand who believed design and social issues ought to be kept separate. Do we take
						this as aesthetic judgments being universal truths forming within a vacuum devoid of cultural
						and historical reference? Even if only said out of ignorance, Rand’s practice still primarily
						served a Western audience, making his statements at best an irresponsible prescription for
						design.
						<br><br>
						Thus to echo sentiments of neutrality refuses to recognize the social context in which work is
						made. The idea that a style can be “international” assumes that its curated formal qualities
						function for any person across cultural lines. By extending itself outside its borders, the
						International Style mobilized the same Western imperialism that sought to supersede whole
						graphic traditions, language loss, and the disappearance of indigenous scripts. What was even
						“international” about International Style if only accessible to Europe and its colonies whom
						underwent a conditioning of white supremacy?

							<br>The Radical Act of <br> Neutrality
							designer <br>
							</h1>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p class="paragraph1" lang="en">
					This act of prescribing racelessness or more broadly neutrality is itself a racial or sided act. An
					urgent questioning forms: What is universal? What templates as neutral? What are our defaults?
					<br>
					<br>
					In white supremacy, whiteness is default. And through the creation of whiteness in America, anything
					outside of it acts as a difference in which it is vehemently targeted. In this context, the idea of
					what “American” is, is incredibly important when considering the idea of conventionally “American.”
					Toni Morrison posed it strikingly, “What parts do the invention and development of whiteness play in
					the construction of what is loosely described as “American?”
					<br>
					<br>
					In this respect, how can we earnestly look at “neutrality” or “universality” or “race-agnostic” if
					it lobotomizes design and diminishes the artist and their work? When we look at Modernism’s
					prescription of the world, it reveals itself as yet another byproduct of white supremacy, centering
					itself as the end-all approach to universal human aesthetics.
					<br>
					<br>
					We can see this as a dangerous act of conglomerating many different cultures into a monolith of
					“humanness” but we ought to underscore that such absorption goes further through the erasure of the
					margins and the elimination of difference.
					<br>
					<br>
					When the default is white, how can design as a “neutral” tool serve anything but whiteness? How can
					design as “universal” communicate when there is no universally adopted language? What is “clean”
					design if not contrasted with an “unclean” aesthetic relentlessly targeted?
					<br>
					<br>
					These sentiments are far from gone today. They have revived themselves into the current digital
					landscape. And when the systems go unchallenged, its byproducts maintain and perpetuate the
					manufacturing of these grim realities. What is Modernism if not the cultural weapon to erase
					nonwhite aesthetics? What then is Design Thinking if not its succeeding methodology for cultural
					white hegemony?

					I had to ensure that this Black excellence got the exposure it deserved, and it was this expanded
					research that manifested into “As, Not For,” which celebrates unsung African-American designers and
					acts
					as a life-sized bibliography, my sources listed within each piece. The exhibition is separated into
					four
					sections. “Parties & Protests” celebrates hip-hop party flyers and the Black Panther newspaper,
					documents used to activate cultures which eventually made an impact internationally. “Advertising &
					Commerce” features designers who ran Black-owned advertising agencies (including thae legendary Art
					Sims, who is currently living in California). “Black Data” focuses on infographics created by W.E.B.
					DuBois documenting African-American life in the early 1900s. And “Musicality” displays hip-hop and
					jazz
					album art by designers who were agents in the rise of popularity of both genres. Collectively, this
					work
					honors a specific aspect of Black culture within its respective decade.

					The two main conceptual inspirations for the show are Harlem Renaissance philosopher, Alain Locke,
					and a 1977 exhibition in Ann Arbor, Michigan titled “Ritual: Baptismal In Black.” My exhibit’s title
					reflects two pieces of Locke’s writing: “As, Not For” is a three-word summary of a passage in his
					book, The New Negro, in which he argues that there is no need for Blackness to be performative to be
					essential within the culture in which it exists. “Dethroning Our Absolutes” is from Locke’s
					philosophical essay, “Values and Imperatives,” which prompts readers to assess their subjectivities
					while being mindful that social norms guide our behavior. “Ritual: Baptismal in Black” asked its
					patrons questions that exposed the knowledge gaps the organizers attempted to fill: “Can your
					faculty/staff/students each name five nationally or internationally active Black artists?” and “Do
					your major art books include the work of major Black artists?”
