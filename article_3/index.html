					but
					mostly as an effort to foster educational and professional equity in the industry.

					As a professional Black designer, I still feel like an anomaly, often finding myself in majority

					educational and professional spaces. And having normalized this feeling of alienation, my formal

					education is rooted in methods developed by mostly white men. I’m sure any African-American who has
					pursued
					a career with little representation can empathize. This feeling, however, is new, because the start
					of my
					life in design actually took place within my own community.

					In graduate school, I completed a history project about Buddy Esquire, a prolific flyer designer who
					worked during the rise of Hip-Hop in the Bronx. The research process left me frustrated. Beside
					a scholarly article by Cornell University graduate student Amanda Lelonde and a few interviews
					online,
					there were no sources. I figured Buddy wasn’t the only historically influential Black designer
					without
					visibility. This was the seed for “As, Not For.”

					During the past year, I’ve tried identifying every African-American graphic designer active between
					1865
					and 1999, following breadcrumb trails to compile a list of designers, locate institutions, visit
					archives, and bask in Black graphic-design greatness. I was, for example, stunned to find out that
					multiple active Chicago based Black-owned advertising agencies were creating stunning campaigns for
					huge
					American brands in the 1960s and 70s. Emmett McBain’s 1972 campaign for Marlboro cigarettes featured
					photos of the most fly 70s-styled Black man smoking a cigarette at the barber shop, or buying a hot
					dog
					on the street, the copy below reading “Where The Flavor Is.”

					I had to ensure that this Black excellence got the exposure it deserved, and it was this expanded
					research that manifested into “As, Not For,” which celebrates unsung African-American designers and
					acts
					as a life-sized bibliography, my sources listed within each piece. The exhibition is separated into
					four
					sections. “Parties & Protests” celebrates hip-hop party flyers and the Black Panther newspaper,
					documents used to activate cultures which eventually made an impact internationally. “Advertising &
					Commerce” features designers who ran Black-owned advertising agencies (including thae legendary Art
					Sims, who is currently living in California). “Black Data” focuses on infographics created by W.E.B.
					DuBois documenting African-American life in the early 1900s. And “Musicality” displays hip-hop and
					jazz
					album art by designers who were agents in the rise of popularity of both genres. Collectively, this
					work
					honors a specific aspect of Black culture within its respective decade.

					The two main conceptual inspirations for the show are Harlem Renaissance philosopher, Alain Locke,
					and a 1977 exhibition in Ann Arbor, Michigan titled “Ritual: Baptismal In Black.” My exhibit’s title
					reflects two pieces of Locke’s writing: “As, Not For” is a three-word summary of a passage in his
					book, The New Negro, in which he argues that there is no need for Blackness to be performative to be
					essential within the culture in which it exists. “Dethroning Our Absolutes” is from Locke’s
					philosophical essay, “Values and Imperatives,” which prompts readers to assess their subjectivities
					while being mindful that social norms guide our behavior. “Ritual: Baptismal in Black” asked its
					patrons questions that exposed the knowledge gaps the organizers attempted to fill: “Can your
					faculty/staff/students each name five nationally or internationally active Black artists?” and “Do
					your major art books include the work of major Black artists?”

					According to the design census administered by the AIGA and Google, as of 2017,
